In my envisioned final work, the focal point is the hat, animated by a mesmerizing dynamic light display. I've meticulously crafted three distinct versions of the light mode. Upon activating the switch, these modes gracefully unfold in sequence, involving a total of 11 lights that compose a symphony of colors. The choreography, executed using p5.js, seamlessly complements the aesthetics of my mask.

The sequence commences with the outermost light gracefully illuminating, followed by a charming dance of four lights in the second cycle, and a harmonious display of five lights in the third cycle. A dazzling display ensues, with all lights flashing in unison five additional times before gracefully resetting and beginning the enchanting cycle anew.

The second version unfolds gradually, each light appearing one by one in a mesmerizing rainbow sequence. The third version strategically combines the theme colors of the mask, spotlighting green and blue in a visually appealing interval design.

Beyond the artistic endeavor, my work holds indirect relevance to programming by encouraging contemplation of the cultural foundations of technological systems. It prompts programmers to reflect on how their work integrates into the broader socio-cultural context. This aspect is particularly significant to me as it forms part of my graduation project, transforming a conventional accessory into a smart technology capable of adjusting its wear patterns in sync with changing moods.

At first, I intended to design the lighting system on both sides or on top of the hat. However, due to the inflexibility of the lamp belt, I opted to sew it directly onto the hat's edge by hand. Interestingly, during this process, I discovered that the lamp belt also complements the ceiling position well, casting vibrant colors onto objects below. This observation has sparked my interest in further exploring its practical applications in the future.
